# The More You Give .. The More You Gain


A visual novel game,
I created it using RenPy, it was my first time to use it but it's so cute and easy
I made the art visuals by Piskel, a pixel art program, so simple and do the job
And the story itself I wrote it by my mind of course.

The game itself is about a boy in Ancient Egypt, who wants to participate in a contest in a well-known festival in his village,
He meets a girl in his team who charms him, he give her kindness, care and more! But what would he gain??
